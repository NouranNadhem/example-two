<h1>Three Success Stories</h1>
<p><strong>LATEMODEL RESTORATION SUPPLY (WACO, TX) </strong>At the early age of 6 years,
Shannon Guderian fell in love with his uncle’s Ford Mustang. When he turned 15, his
mother bought him his very own 1965 Mustang. Before he acquired his driver’s license,
Guderian would sneak out at night to listen to the V8 engine. For him, Mustangs were a
lifestyle, representing image and freedom.</p>
<p>Guderian began his career in the automotive world straight out of high school, working
for a Mustang parts company. At age 26, seeing the need for parts for
late-model cars, Guderian quit his job and pursued his dream. With only
$7,000 in his pocket from selling his car, and without any business experience,
he started calling on everyone he knew in the industry, asking
for advice. He explains, <b>“My goal was to create credibility within the
industry.”</b></p>
<p>Starting with 17 part numbers from one vendor and a $20,000 bank loan to help fi nance his small inventory, Guderian originally located his business in a 650-square-foot <b>“hole in the wall.”</b> Today, the business is in a 27,000-squarefoot building with a showroom where he displays Mustangs. His annual sales have now reached over $10 million.</p>
<p>Guderian is proud of his accomplishments, but he is not patting himself on the back. Crediting God and friends for his success, Guderian says, <b>“This is not something I could have created
on my own. . . . Twenty-three of the 35 people who work for the business now own Mustangs. A lot of these people I knew before they had driver’s licenses. They are an important part of my foundation.”</b></p>
